<h1 align="center">🎯 Guess The Number Game</h1>
###
<h4 align="center">A challenging number guessing game built in C, featuring a stack-based fail tracking system. Test your intuition across three difficulty modes and learn from your mistakes with intelligent guess tracking. This project showcases data structures, dynamic memory management, and interactive console UI design.</h4>
###
<h1 align="center">✨ Features</h1>
###
<h4 align="center">🎲 Three difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard)<br><br>📊 Stack-based failed attempts tracking<br><br>🎨 Color-coded UI (Green for wins, Red for losses)<br><br>📈 Attempt history with detailed feedback<br><br>🔄 Play again functionality<br><br>💡 Real-time hints (Too High/Too Low)</h4>
###
<h1 align="center">🎮 Game Modes</h1>
###
<h4 align="center">🟢 Easy Mode: Guess between 1-20 (5 tries)<br><br>🟡 Medium Mode: Guess between 1-50 (7 tries)<br><br>🔴 Hard Mode: Guess between 1-100 (10 tries)</h4>
###
<h1 align="center">🛠️ Installation & Compilation</h1>
###
<h4 align="center">Prerequisites: C compiler (GCC recommended) & Windows OS<br><br>Compile: gcc GuessTheNumber.c -o GuessTheNumber<br><br>Run: GuessTheNumber.exe</h4>
###
<h1 align="center">🕹️ How to Play</h1>
###
<h4 align="center">Select your difficulty mode (1-3)<br><br>Enter your guess when prompted<br><br>Follow the hints (Too High/Too Low) to narrow down the number<br><br>Win by guessing correctly within the allowed tries<br><br>View your failed attempts history if you lose<br><br>Play again or return to the main menu</h4>
###
<h1 align="center">🧠 How It Works</h1>
###
<h4 align="center">The game uses a stack data structure implemented with linked lists to track all failed guesses. Each incorrect guess is pushed onto the stack, allowing players to review their attempt history after losing. The stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, showing the most recent guesses first. This approach demonstrates practical application of data structures in game development while providing valuable feedback to players.</h4>
